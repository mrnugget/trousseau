## What

*Trousseau* is an encrypted key-value store designed to be a *simple*, *safe* and *trustworthy* place for your data.

It stores data in a single file, encrypted using the openpgp asymmetric encryption algorithm.
It can be easily exported and imported to/from multiple remote storages: like S3, an ssh endpoint, gist (ftp, dropbox, and more to come...). 
It is able to restrict access to the data store to a set of openpgp recipients. 

Create a *trousseau* data store, specify which *opengpg* recipients are allowed to open and modify it, add some key-value pairs to it, export it to S3 for example, and re-import it on another device: As simple as that.

*Secrets are made to be shared, just not with anyone.* Whether you're an admin, a paranoid guy living in a bunker, or a random user who seeks a simple way to store it's critical data in secured manner. *Trousseau* can do something for you.

## Why

Storing, transporting, and sharing sensitive data can be hard, and much more difficult when it comes to automate it.

*Trousseau* was created with private keys transportation and sharing across a servers cluster in mind.
However it has proved being useful to anyone who need to store and eventually share a passwords store, bank accounts details or even more sensitive data.

### Real world use cases

#### For the admins out there

*Trousseau can be useful to you when it comes to*:

* **Store** sensitive data: No more plain certificates and keys in your repositories and configuration files. Your brand new shiny infrastructure surely relies on many certificates and private keys of different kinds: ssl, rsa, gpg, ... *Trousseau* provides a simple and fine-tuned way to store their content in a single file that you can safely version using your favorite cvs. 
* **Share** passwords, keys and other critical data with co-workers and servers in your cluster in a safe manner. *Trousseau* encrypts its content for the specific recipient you provide it. Only the recipient you intend will be able to import and read-write the *Trousseau* store content. *Trousseau* proved itself to be a great way to share some services passwords with your co-workers too!
* **Deploy** keys to your servers in a safe and normative way. Encrypt the trousseau store for each server selectively.

#### For the common users

* **Store** your sensitive data like passwords, bank account details, sex tapes involving you and your teachers or whatever comes to your mind in an encrypted store.
* **Sync** your sensitive data store to remote services and easily share it between your unix-like devices.


## How

### Installation

#### Debian and ubuntu

A binary debian repository provides *trousseau* packages for *i386*, *x86_64* and *arm* architectures, so you can easily install it.
Just add the repository to your sources.list:

```bash
$ echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/oleiade/deb /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trousseau.list
```

And you're ready to go:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install trousseau
```

#### OSX

##### Homebrew

If you're using homebrew just proceed to installation using the provided formula:

```bash
$ brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oleiade/trousseau/master/trousseau.rb
```

*Et voila!*

##### Macports

Coming soon (Don't be shy, if you feel like you could do it, just send pull request ;) )

#### Build it

1. First, make sure you have a [Go](http://http://golang.org/) language compiler **>= 1.2** (*mandatory*) and [git](http://gitscm.org) installed.
2. Make sure you have the following go system dependencies in your ``$PATH``: ``bzr, svn, hg, git``
3. Ensure your [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH) is properly set.
4. Run ``make``

### Prerequisities

#### Gpg passphrase

Every decryption operations will require your *gpg* primary key passphrase.
As of today, **trousseau** is able to handle your passphrase through multiple ways:
* system's keyring manager
* gpg-agent daemon
* system environment
* ``--passphrase`` global option

##### Keyring manager

Supported system keyring manager are osx keychain access and linux gnome secret-service and gnome-keychain (more might be added in the future on demand).
To use the keyring manager you will need to set up the ``TROUSSEAU_KEYRING_SERVICE`` environment variable to the name of they keyring manager key holding the trousseau main gpg key passphrase.

```bash
$ export TROUSSEAU_KEYRING_SERVICE=my_keyring_key
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Gpg agent

Another authentication method supported is gpg-agent. In order to use it make sure you've started the gpg-agent daemon and exported the ``GPG_AGENT_INFO`` variable, trousseau will do the rest.

```bash
$ export GPG_AGENT_INFO=path_to_the_gpg_agent_info_file
$ export TROUSSEAU_MASTER_GPG_ID=myid@mymail.com
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Environment variable

Alternatively, you can pass your primary key passphrase as `TROUSSEAU_PASSPHRASE` environment variable:

```bash
$ export TROUSSEAU_PASSPHRASE=mysupperdupperpassphrase
$ trousseau get abc
```

##### Passphrase global option

Ultimately, you can pass you gpg passphrase through the command line global option:

```bash
$ trousseau --passphrase mysupperdupperpassphrase get abc
```

#### Environment

Trousseau behavior can be controlled through the system environment:

* *TROUSSEAU_STORE* : if you want to have multiple trousseau data store, set this environment variable to the path of the one you want to use. Default is ``$HOME/.trousseau``

## Let's get started

### Basics

First use of **trousseau** requires the data store to be created. A **trousseau** data store is built and maintained for a list of *gpg* recipients who will be the only ones able to decrypt and manipulate it (so don't forget to include yourself ;) )
Moreover, you can easily create/select multiple stores using whether the ``--store`` global option or the ``TROUSSEAU_STORE`` environment variable mentioned upper in this *README*.

#### API

##### Commands

* **create** [RECIPIENTS ...] : creates the trousseau encrypted datastore for provided recipients and stores it in `$HOME/.trousseau`
* **upgrade** : Will upgrade your data store to be compatible with a newer version of trousseau. For example, to upgrade a data store created by trousseau <= 0.3.1 to be compatible with trousseau >= 0.3.1
* **meta** : Outputs the store metadata.
* **add-recipient** RECIPIENT : Adds a recipient to the store. The recipient will be able to open and modify the store.
* **list-recipients** : Lists the data store recipients.
* **remove-recipient** RECIPIENT : Removes a recipient from the store. The recipient will not be able to open or modify the store.

##### Global options

* ``--store`` [PATH] : select an alternative trousseau data store path. This option is really helpful when you want to manipulate multiple stores.

#### First steps with the data store

```bash
# create a trousseau for two gpg recipients
# both key ids and key email are supported.
$ trousseau create 4B7D890,foo@bar.com 
trousseau created at $HOME/.trousseau
```

Trousseau data store consists in single gpg encrypted file residing in your ``$HOME`` directory. Check by yourself.

```bash
$ cat ~/.trousseau
{
    "crypto_type":1,
    "crypto_algorithm":0,
    "_data":"012ue091ido19d81j2d01029dj1029d1029u401294i ... 1028019k0912djm0129d12"
}
```

If you've just updated trousseau to a version marked as implying backward incompatibilities, the ``upgrade`` command is here to help

```bash
$ trousseau upgrade
Upgrading trousseau data store to version M: success
Upgrading trousseau data store to version N: success
# This is it, your legacy data store has now been upgraded to be compatible with
# your current version of trousseau
```

### Manipulating keys

Once your trousseau has been created, you're now able to read, write, list, delete its data. Here's how the fun part goes.

#### API

* **get** KEY [--file]: Outputs the stored KEY-value pair, whether on *stdout* or in pointed ``--file`` option path.
* **set** KEY [VALUE | --file] : Sets the provided key-value pair in store using provided value or extracting it from path pointed by ``--file`` option.
* **rename** KEY_NAME NEW_NAME : Renames a store key
* **del** KEY : Deletes provided key from the store
* **keys** : Lists the stored keys
* **show** : Lists the stored key-value pairs

#### You've got the keys

```bash
# Right now the store is empty
$ trousseau show


# Let's add some data into it
$ trousseau set abc 123
$ trousseau set "easy as" "do re mi"

# set action supports a --file flag to use the content
# of a file as value
$ trousseau set myuser.ssh.public_key --file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub


# Now let's make sure data has been added
$ trousseau keys
abc
easy as
myuser.ssh.public_key

# Let's check values too
$ trousseau get abc
123

# What about renaming abc key, just for fun?
$ trousseau rename abc 'my friend jackson'
$ trousseau keys 
my friend jackson
easy as
myuser.ssh.public_key


$ trousseau show
my friend jackson: 123
easy as: do re mi
myuser.ssh.public_key: ssh-rsa 1289eu102ij30192u3e0912e
...

# Whenever you want to export a key value to a file, just use
# the get command --file option
$ trousseau get myuser.ssh.public_key --file /home/myuser/id_rsa.pub

# Now if you don't need a key anymore, just drop it.
$ trousseau del 'my friend jackson' # Now the song lacks something doesn't it?
```

### Importing/Exporting to remote storage

Trousseau was built with data remote storage in mind. Therefore it provides *push* and *pull* actions to export and import the trousseau data store to remote destinations.
As of today S3, SSH and gist storages are available (more are to come).

#### API

* **push** : Pushes the trousseau data store to remote storage
* **pull** : Pulls the trousseau data store from remote storage

#### DSN

In order to make your life easier trousseau allows you to select your export and import sources using a *DSN*.

```
    {protocol}://{identifier}:{secret}@{host}:{port}/{path}
```

* **protocol**: The remote service target type. Can be one of: *s3* or *scp*
* **identifier**: The login/key/whatever to authenticate **trousseau** to the remote service. Provide your *aws_access_key* if you're targeting *s3*, or your remote login if you're targeting *scp*.
* **secret**: The secret to authenticate **trousseau** to the remote service. Provide your *aws_secret_key* if you're targeting *s3*, or your remote password if you're targeting *scp*.
* **host**: Your bucket name is you're targeting *s3*. The host to login to using *scp* otherwise.
* **port**: The *aws_region* if you're targeting *s3*. The port to login to using *scp* otherwise.
* **path**: The remote path to push to or retrieve from the trousseau file on a ``push`` or ``pull`` action.

#### S3 Example

```bash
# Considering a non empty trousseau data store
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi

# And then you're ready to push
$ trousseau push s3://aws_access_key:aws_secret_key@bucket:region/remote_file_path


# Now that data store is pushed to S3, let's remove the
# local data store and pull it once again to ensure it worked
$ rm ~/.trousseau
$ trousseau show
Trousseau unconfigured: no data store

$ trousseau pull s3://aws_access_key:aws_secret_key@bucket:region/remote_file_path
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
```

#### Scp example

```bash
# We start with a non-empty trousseau data store
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi

# To push it using scp we need to provide it a couple of
# basic options.
# Nota: In order for your remote password not to appear
# in your shell history, we strongly advise you to use
# the push/pull --ask-password option instead of supplying
# the password through the dsn.
$ trousseau push --ask-password scp://user:@host:port/remote_file_path
Password: 
Trousseau data store succesfully pushed to ssh remote storage


# Now that data store has been pushed to the remote storage
# using scp, let's remove the local data store and pull it
# once again to ensure it worked
$ rm ~/.trousseau
$ trousseau show
Trousseau unconfigured: no data store

$ trousseau pull --ask-password scp://user:@host:port/remote_file_path
Password:
Trousseau data store succesfully pulled from ssh remote storage

$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
```

#### Gist example

To use the gist remote storage support, you will need to generate a Github [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/applications#personal-access-tokens).
Once you've generated one, use it as the dsn *password* field as in the following example:

```bash
# We start with a non-empty trousseau data store
$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi

# Nota:
# * Gist remote storage doesn't use the host and port dsn fields,
#   but you still need to provide their ':' separator
$ trousseau push gist://user:mysuppedupertoken@:/gist_name
Password: 
Trousseau data store succesfully pushed to gist remote storage


# Now that data store has been pushed to gist
# let's remove the local data store and pull it
# once again to ensure it worked
$ rm ~/.trousseau
$ trousseau show
Trousseau unconfigured: no data store

$ trousseau pull gist://user:mysupperduppertoken@:/gist_name
Password:
Trousseau data store succesfully pulled from gist

$ trousseau show
abc: 123
easy as: do re mi
```

### Local imports and exports

#### API

* **import** FILENAME: will import a trousseau data store from the local filesystem. The operation **erases** the current trousseau store content.
* **export** FILENAME: will export the current trousseau data store as `FILENAME` on the local fs.

#### Real world example

```bash
$ trousseau export testtrousseau.asc  # Fine we've exported our current data store into a single file
$ mail -f testtrousseau.asc cousin@machin.com  # Let's pretend we've sent it by mail

# Now cousin machin is now able to import the data store
$ trousseau import testtrousseau.asc
$ trousseau show
cousin_machin:isagreatbuddy
adams_family:rests in peace, for sure
```

### Metadata

Trousseau keeps track and exposes all sort of metadata about your store that you can access through the ``meta`` command.

```bash
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890,28EA78B]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c
```

Once again, if you're intersted in how the meta data are stored, go check yourself by decrypting the store content using one of your recipients private key.

```bash
$ cat ~/.trousseau | gpg -d -r 4B7D890 --textmode
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "My Gpg User <MyGpg@mail.com>"
2048-bit RSA key, ID 4B7D890, created 2013-05-21 (main key ID 4B7D890)

gpg: encrypted with 2048-bit RSA key, ID 4B7D890, created 2013-05-21
  "My Gpg User <MyGpg@mail.com>"
{"_meta":{"created_at":"2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST","last_modified_at":"2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST","recipients":["92EDE36B"],"version":"0.1.0"},"data":{}}
```

### Adding and removing recipients

Okay, so you've created a trousseau data store with two recipients allowed to manipulate it. Now suppose you'd like to add another recipient to be able to open and update the trousseau store; or to remove one.
``add-recipient`` and ``remove-recipient`` commands can help you with that.

```bash
$ trousseau add-recipient 75FE3AB
$ trousseau add-recipient 869FA4A
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890, 75FE3AB, 869FA4A]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c

$ trousseau remove-recipient 75FE3AB
$ trousseau meta
CreatedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457477714 +0200 CEST
LastModifiedAt: 2013-08-12 08:00:20.457586991 +0200 CEST
Recipients: [4B7D890, 869FA4A]
TrousseauVersion: 0.1.0c
```
